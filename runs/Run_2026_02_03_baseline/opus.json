      "rank": 1,
      "style": "Pop Art",
      "appeal_score": 9.2,
      "reasoning": "Pop Art images deliver immediate visual impact with their bold halftone dots, vibrant color blocking, and Warhol/Lichtenstein aesthetic. The tiramisu pop art (img_003) was particularly striking with its red/yellow/blue palette creating a visually arresting image. The pelican pop art transformed an ordinary wildlife photo into something that feels gallery-worthy. Users would be excited to share these as they're instantly recognizable as artistic transformations."

    {
      "rank": 2,
      "style": "Storybook",
      "appeal_score": 8.5,
      "reasoning": "Storybook transformations create warm, nostalgic imagery with soft watercolor textures. The pelican storybook (img_001) captured a charming illustrated quality suitable for children's content. The food images gained a cozy, hand-illustrated feel. These images evoke comfort and would appeal to users wanting a gentle, artistic touch. Strong shareability for family-oriented content."

    {
      "rank": 3,
      "style": "Anime",
      "appeal_score": 5.0,
      "reasoning": "Anime transformations showed limited visual transformation for the test images. The food images (img_002, img_003) showed minimal anime styling - the tiramisu photos appeared largely unchanged from originals. The pelican (img_001) had some cel-shading effects but lacked the distinctive anime character aesthetic. Users would not be excited to share these as 'anime versions' since the transformation isn't compelling for non-human subjects."

    "key_observation": "Pop Art's bold graphic style creates the strongest immediate visual impact and 'wow factor'. Storybook provides warm, family-friendly appeal. Anime requires human subjects with faces to achieve its distinctive look.",
    "recommendation": "Pop Art is the clear winner for user delight and shareability across diverse image types."
