The style transformation was technically excellent with clear halftone dots, bold outlines, and limited color palettes applied uniformly. All images passed every assertion in Accuracy, Completeness, Relevance, Usefulness, and Exceptional dimensions. The style works exceptionally well for both people and food subjects."

All assertions passed in core dimensions. Slightly lower exceptional scores compared to Pop Art, but still high-quality professional results suitable for children's content and printing."

      "avg_grade": "F",
      "reasoning": "Anime performed poorly across all images (40.8%, 10.3%, 44.8%). The style assertions are designed for human subjects (large expressive eyes, facial proportions, protagonist quality) which don't apply to the wildlife/food images in this test set. The Anime preset failed to achieve meaningful style transfer for non-human subjects, resulting in failed accuracy and exceptional dimensions."
