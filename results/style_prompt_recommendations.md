## Honorable Mentions

**Chinese Ink Wash Painting** - Another excellent cultural art style that could be paired with Ukiyo-e for an "Asian Art" collection.

**Ethereal Fantasy** - Beautiful glowing magical effect, but may overlap somewhat with existing "Neon Glow" and "Hologram" presets.

**Wes Anderson Aesthetic** - Highly distinctive, but may be too niche for general audience recognition.
