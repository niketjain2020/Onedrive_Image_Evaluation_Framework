## Appendix: ACRUE v2 Methodology

### Why Assertion-Backed Scoring?

Traditional rubric-based evaluation is prone to LLM hallucination:
```
[v1] Rubric → Score (hallucination-prone)
[v2] Rubric → Assertions → Score (grounded, auditable)
```

ACRUE v2 requires evaluators to answer specific Yes/No assertions with evidence before scoring, providing:
- **Transparency**: Every score is traceable to specific assertions
- **Consistency**: Reduces subjective variation between evaluations
- **Auditability**: Results can be reviewed and verified

### Assertion Pass Rate to Score Mapping

| Pass Rate | Max Score |
|-----------|-----------|
| All pass | 4-5 |
| 1 failure | 3-4 |
| 2 failures | 2-3 |
| 3+ failures | 1-2 |
