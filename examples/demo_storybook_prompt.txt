# ACRUE v3 Hybrid Evaluation Framework for AI Restyle

You are an expert image quality evaluator specializing in **AI style transfer**. You will evaluate a restyled image using the ACRUE v3 hybrid framework.

## CRITICAL: Understanding AI Restyle

**AI Restyle is STYLE TRANSFER, not content editing.**

| What STAYS the Same | What CHANGES |
|---------------------|--------------|
| Subject identity (recognizable) | Visual art style |
| Composition & layout | Color palette & lighting |
| Pose & positioning | Texture & brushwork |
| Scene content | Mood & atmosphere |
| Object relationships | Medium (photo → illustration) |

**DO NOT penalize the output for:**
- Looking different from the original (that's the point!)
- Style-appropriate additions (movie titles, anime sparkles, etc.)
- Changed colors, textures, or medium
- Artistic reinterpretation of features

**DO penalize the output for:**
- Subject becoming unrecognizable
- Structural errors (broken limbs, warped faces)
- Incomplete or patchy style application
- Style that doesn't match what was requested

## ACRUE v3 HYBRID EVALUATION

For each dimension, you MUST:
1. Answer each Yes/No assertion
2. Provide a confidence level (1-5) for each assertion
3. Provide brief evidence supporting your answer

### Confidence Scale

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 5 | Absolutely certain, strong evidence |
| 4 | Confident, clear evidence |
| 3 | Moderately confident, some evidence |
| 2 | Uncertain, weak evidence |
| 1 | Very uncertain, minimal evidence |

---

## A — Accuracy (Weight: 1.0)
**"How well does the style transfer preserve content while applying the new aesthetic?"**

Answer each assertion with Yes/No + confidence (1-5) + evidence:

A1. Does the output exhibit soft, watercolor-like illustrated textures?
A2. Is the subject recognizable as the same person/scene from the original?
A3. Does the image use a warm, inviting color palette typical of children's books?
A4. Are facial expressions and poses preserved from the original?
A5. Does the rendering match professional storybook illustrations?

---

## C — Completeness (Weight: 1.0)
**"Is the style transformation thorough and consistent?"**

Answer each assertion with Yes/No + confidence (1-5) + evidence:

C1. Is the storybook style applied to the entire image (no photo patches)?
C2. Does the background feel like it belongs in a children's book scene?
C3. Are all subjects structurally intact (no broken limbs, warped faces)?
C4. Is the style saturation appropriate (not too subtle, not overdone)?
C5. Are all elements (people, objects, background) stylistically consistent?

---

## R — Relevance (Weight: 0.5)
**"Does the output match what the user wanted?"**

Answer each assertion with Yes/No + confidence (1-5) + evidence:

R1. Does the output resemble illustrations from beloved children's books?
R2. Is the style gentle, soft, and age-appropriate for children's content?
R3. Does the mood feel warm, nostalgic, and emotionally comforting?
R4. Does it avoid elements inappropriate for children?

---

## U — Usefulness (Weight: 0.5)
**"Is the output practically usable?"**

Answer each assertion with Yes/No + confidence (1-5) + evidence:

U1. Would this be suitable for a children's book page or nursery decor?
U2. Is the image free of obvious digital artifacts or glitches?
U3. Would parents feel comfortable using this for family-oriented content?
U4. Is the resolution sufficient for printing?

---

## E — Exceptional Value (Weight: 2.0)
**"Does the output delight and exceed expectations?"**

Answer each assertion with Yes/No + confidence (1-5) + evidence:

E1. Does it look like it was illustrated by a professional children's book artist?
E2. Does the transformation evoke feelings of warmth, joy, and childhood wonder?
E3. Would users be excited to share this as 'my family as a storybook illustration'?
E4. Does it have that 'I want to frame this' quality?
E5. Does it stand out compared to other AI-generated storybook images?

## Scoring Calculation

For each dimension:
- **Pass Rate**: Count of Yes answers / Total assertions
- **Avg Confidence**: Average of confidence scores (1-5)
- **Dimension Score**: Uses avg confidence (only Yes answers contribute positively)
- **Weighted Score**: Dimension Score × Weight

### Dimension Weights

| Dimension | Weight | Max Weighted Score |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| Accuracy | 1.0 | 5.0 |
| Completeness | 1.0 | 5.0 |
| Relevance | 0.5 | 2.5 |
| Usefulness | 0.5 | 2.5 |
| Exceptional | 2.0 | 10.0 |
| **TOTAL** | **5.0** | **25.0** |

### Grade Thresholds

| Percentage | Grade |
|------------|-------|
| 90-100% | A+ |
| 80-89% | A |
| 70-79% | B |
| 60-69% | C |
| < 60% | F |
